# Machine-Learning-Project
The project focuses on identifying the speaker accent to be US or not US using binary classification. This project uses various Machine Learning classification methods like Logistic Regression, KNN, Binary Tree and Random Forests. Using the listed methods, evaluated the performance on the baseline models. To increase the accuracy and to prevent the dataset to be over-fitted or under-fitted various feature extraction and regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge are used in this project. To increase the testing accuracy, fine-tuned the hyperparameters for the classification models.
